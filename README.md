# Laravel 9 + Breeze + Vite + Vue2 Starter Template

This project is a starter project to make the front end of [Laravel 9](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) + [Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) with [Vue2](https://vuejs.org/). The front-end build system has Vite that supports default from Laravel `9.2.0`, which enables high-speed compilation.

The language used is TypeScript. The Vue part adopts the [Composition API](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) writing method, but it is also possible to install [vue-propertey-decolator](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator) etc. if necessary.

Also, in order to maintain the code quality, [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) by [phpcs](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) is built in PHP in advance, and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) setting of [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) is built in the TypeScript part. (Same as [vite-vue2-ts-starter](https://github.com/logue/vite-vue2-ts-starter).)
